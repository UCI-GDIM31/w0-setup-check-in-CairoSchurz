# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

    I'm Cairo (she/her), a second year CS major. I like to play a lot of different games, most recently has been Cult of the Lamb, Risk of Rain 2, Outer Wilds, Satisfactory, as well as some others. I do have some experience with game development, mainly through the Video Game Development Club here last year. I went to some of the workshops, participated on a pitch project each quarter, and also just hung out in the game lab and met some really cool people I learned from too. I don't have too much of an idea of what kind of games I hope to build, other than I do want to just try new things and learn more skills!


2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [x] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
            - Computer Science
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

    I'm hoping to improve my skills at game development and learn more in a class format to fill in any gaps in my knowledge I've gained from figuring things out in VGDC projects.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

    I don't think there's really anything I'm nervous about, at least not at this current time.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

    Learned Java in high school through AP Computer Science A, as well as 3 years as the lead programmer for the school's FIRST Robotics team. Learned Python last year in ICS 32A and 33. Some knowledge of C# just from experience with game development in Unity.

2. Game development (any engine)

    Did one game jam and two longer game projects through VGDC last year. 

3. Unity

    Learned part of some Unity tutorials many years ago, as well as worked in Unity all of last year through VGDC pitch projects.


### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

    A document created to contain the ideas of the game, such as the engine, goals, genre, and other design things.

2. Scope management

    Trying to keep things within what is reasonable to complete with the people, skill levels, and time available, cutting proposed features if needed.

3. Iteration

    The process of doing something multiple times. Refers to loops or repeated actions in code. Also could be iterating upon the idea of a game by attempting something, seeing what worked and what didn't, and then attempting again with new knowledge.

4. Object-Oriented programming

    Programming where scripts exist on objects that store their own data and components, rather than single files that are just run on their own.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture

    Architecture where the model controls the basic rules of the system, the view controls any inputs or outputs and user experience, and the controller acts as thr intermediary between them.
